Over the past two years, as I have moved
to break the betrayal of my own silences
and to speak from the burnings of my own
heart, as I have called for radical
departures from the destruction of
Vietnam, many persons have questioned me
about the wisdom of my path. At the
heart of their concerns this query has
often loomed large and loud: "Why are
you speaking about the war, Dr. King?"
"Why are you joining the voices of
dissent?" "Peace and civil rights don't
mix," they say. "Aren't you hurting the
cause of your people," they ask? And
when I hear them, though I often
understand the source of their concern,
I am nevertheless greatly saddened, for
such questions mean that the inquirers
have not really known me, my commitment
or my calling. Indeed, their questions
suggest that they do not know the world
in which they live.
